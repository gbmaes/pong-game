# pong-game

One of the oldest games ever made 

After studying this project in the online coding school Alura, I developed this game using **Scratch** and then I did everything over again but this time using *Javascript* in the library **P5.js**

>This code won't work on VScode or others code-editors

>It will only work on P5.js

> You can see the code and even play a bit here: https://editor.p5js.org/gbmaes/sketches/qMifXywg6

>Or you can just play the Scratch version (recommended if you just want to play it): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/722633263/

By the way I made it multiplayer version so you can play with your friends or family!

>Player 1 commands: UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW;

>Player 2 commands: W(up) and S(down);
